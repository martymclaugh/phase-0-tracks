-research basics of jquery
-find out exactly what it is
-find a cheat sheet
-figure out basic syntax
-check out any online sources that do a coverage of jquery 
-look up any basic videos of jquery
-follow along with a tutorial

While I didn't watch any videos I found that w3schools was a great tutorial to read through quickly. You can skim through sections and try out the premade codes they have that explain the concepts and edit the code to do whatever you like. I thought that this was a great way for me to cover jquery in a small amount of time.

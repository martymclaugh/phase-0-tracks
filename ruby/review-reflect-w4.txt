1. What is a variable? Why might a programmer use a variable?
-A variable is a place holder for information. 
-Programmers use variables so that they may change this information inside.

2. If the value of first_name is "Abraham" and last_name is "Lincoln", explain the order in which Ruby will run the line full_name = first_name + last_name, and what the final result will be.
-Ruby would read the following as the first name and the last name combined is the full name. The result would be “AbrahamLincoln”
3. For each of the following data types, write a short definition and give at least one example of when you might use the data type in a program. (Don't use an example we've already provided.)

-string - words in quotations - “a string”
-integer - numbers - 45
-float - decimals - 5.6
-nil - nothing -   
-boolean - true or false

4. What is an algorithm?
- A set of steps written out to solve a problem

5. What are two common categories of algorithm in computer science? 
-Drawing
-Psuedocoding

6. What is a method? Why might a programmer choose to use a method?
-A method is used to contain some repeatable coding in a variable
-Coders might use methods so they can call upon the same code without having to rewrite it

7. Define the following terms as they relate to a method. 

-return value - what returns at the end of a method
-side effect - when it changes a value of a variable
-parameter - the variables a method takes in
-argument - expression used when calling the method
-implicit return - what is returned in ruby by default at the end of a method

8. What are global scope and method scope? How do those scopes impact the availability of data at different points in a program?
-global scope is variables accessible from the entire program
-method scope is only accessible to a certain instance
-global scopes would be available all the time, where as method scopes would be specific times.

9. What is control flow? Why might a programmer choose to use flow control?
basically how you control the flow in ruby using loops, if statements, while and until.
10. Define the following terms as they relate to flow control.

loop - will go through code in a loop until specified to stop.
if - reads as an if then statement. If blank happens then blank.
else - reads as if none of the conditions above can happen, then this will happen:
elsif - reads as or if
while - a loop condition. While something is happening make this happen.
until - another loop condition. Used to go through a set of code until a certain condition is met.

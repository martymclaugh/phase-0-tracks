1. What are classes? Be sure to define the following terms in your explanation and describe the relationships between them:

class - objects that exist or you can create to be used in a program
state - the collection of data, variables, and attributes
behavior - the methods inside that class
instance variable - local variables that are used to help set the state of a class throughout its definition
instance method - methods called on inside a class

2. What are attributes?
properties that are either readable and/or writable (getters and setters)

3. Give an example of a real world object, and describe how you might assign its attributes if you were to design a class to represent that object.
Soccer ball
I would set the attr_reader :shape since all soccer balls are round
I would set the attr_accessor :size :color since you can get different colored and sized soccer balls

4. What is the purpose of the initialize method? When does it run?
the initialize method allows a coder to put in certain parameters need for the class.
It runs when you create a new instance of the class.

5. What are modules?
methods that don’t have specific behavior or attributes and you don’t need multiple copies of

6. What are the different ways you can use a module?
provide organization for a method and so that one programmer wouldn’t overwrite the method of another programmer

they can be written as “mixing” to help classes work better.

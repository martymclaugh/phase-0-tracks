Data Structures
1. Why are data structures useful in programming?
-Provide a way for programmers to store data and assign values to things

Arrays
2. Define "array" and describe the characteristics of an array.
-A data structure with a list of values or variables. An array consists of brackets [] and is identified by a key in front of it. You can access values or variables in the array by using the 0 index.

3. Give two original examples of data sets that an array might be well-suited for.
-Available colors for a paint job on a car
-Number of times Homer says “Doh” in an episode of the Simpsons

Hashes
4. Define "hash" and describe the characteristics of a hash.
-A hash is data structure that stores information of keys and values. A hash consists of curly braces {} and may contain other hashes or arrays inside of it

5. Give two original examples of data sets that a hash might be well-suited for.
-Different types of produce at the grocery store, what color the produce is, the inventory of that produce
-Bikes in a bike shop and how many gears they have.

Iteration
6. Why is iteration useful?
-It gives you the ability to go through each item in an array or hash and change it somehow

7. Give an example of a real-life task that would require iteration if you wrote an algorithm for it.
-Chopping 12 different ingredients for a salad.

Blocks
8. What is a block?
-code that you would put inside an iteration. You may write a multi line block or an inline block

9. What is a block parameter, and where does its value come from?
-A variable you put inside pipes || you create to have the code do something to the values you call on. Its value comes from the parameters you assign to the block code.
